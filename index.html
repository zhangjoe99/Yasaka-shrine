                The Yasaka Shrine is one of the most famous shrines in Japan, known for its annual Gion Matsuri festival. The Shrine was founded over 1350 years ago under the reign of Emperor Seimei and is dedicated to Susanoo no Mikoto. The shrine was originally called the <i>Gion Kanshin In</i> and was changed to Yasaka at the time of the Meiji Restoration. <i>Gion</i> comes from Buddhism and the <i>In</i> also represents a Buddhist temple: the relationship to Buddhism is pretty common as they are both major parts of Japanese religion.

                The first ceremony was held in 970 for exorcising the demons of pestilence. This is also closely related to the worship of phallic road gods. The long poles/spears on the tops of the floats are known as <i>hoko</i>, and represent phalli. The belief was that phallic images countered the evil threatening to take life. Only the life brought by reproduction can counter death and the festival is an attempt to stop an epidemic. This is a key concept we see in Buddhism and is one example we see of Shinto and Buddhism coming together.

                        The Yasaka shrine is found between the Gion District and Higashiyama District. As we approach Yasaka shrine, we might see the Nishi-romon gate on the east side with two bronze lion statues. The two lion statues represent the guardians of the shrine, similar to the many other guardian statues of other shrines. The Nishi-romon gate is considered the symbol of the Higashiyama district but the main gate is the Minami-romon Gate to the south. Rather than two guardian Deva kings we see at most shrine entrances, the Nishi-romon gate has two wooden statues of Zuishin.

                        The shrine's main hall consists of the <i>honden</i> (inner sanctuary) and <i>haiden</i> (offering hall). The main hall is 15 meters tall and the roof is made of hinoki bark. There is a dance stage in front of the main hall with hundreds of lanterns that get lit in the evenings. Local businesses can donate and have their name written on a lantern. Legend says that there is a bottomless pond where a blue dragon resides under the main hall. The dragon draws energy from the water and acts as a guardian for Kyoto.

            <h4>Kami</h4>
            <div class="text">
                The kami associated with the Yasaka shrine are Amaterasu-Omikami and Susanoo-no-mikoto. Both these kami are heavenly and reside in the heavenly land Amatsukami. Susanoo-no-mikoto is known as the storm god and Amaterasu is his older sister, the sun goddess. It is said that Amaterasu-Omikami committed various crimes and was finally banished from the Plain of High Heaven. Amaterasu was confronted with various problems and was able to overcome them. Susanoo-no-mikoto is considered the most attractive deity in Japanese mythology.

                Ekijin shrine is a small shrine attached to Yasaka shrine. There is a myth where Susanoo-no-mikoto was traveling around Japan and met Somin Shorai, who offered shelter even though he was poor. Because of his kindness, Susanoo-no-mikoto told him that if an epidemic were to occur, Somin Shorai should wrap large thatch ropes around the waists of all his descendants. This would protect them from the disease. As a result, on July 31 of every year, Nagoshisai Matsuri is held at Ekijin shrine for Susanoo-no-mikoto. During the ceremony, people hand protective charms on a large thatch rope. The charms have the words “I am descended from Somin Shorai” on them and are hung on people’s doors to ward off evil.

                The Gion festival is one of the most famous festivals in Japan and has been held in the Yasaka shrine for the past one thousand years. The festival began in 869 AD when an epidemic swept through the lands and the festival was a purification ritual to appease the kami. The festival is held between July 1 to 31. There are many ceremonies that take place during the festival. After much planning on July 1 and July 2, the first event occurs on July 10 called <i>Omukae-chouchin</i> (Paper lantern reception) and <i>Mikoshi-arai</i> (Ceremony to wash Mikoshi). Also, the <i>Hoko-tate</i> and <i>Yama-tate</i>, massive floats for the parade, begin construction. On the 13th, there is a rite called <i>Naginata-boko Chigo-shasan</i> where children are chosen to ride on the <i>Naginata-boko</i> float in the festival. On July 28, there is also a purification ceremony held on the Shijo St. Bridge.

                The main event is on the 17th but the three days leading up to the precession are known as <i>yoi-yoi-yoi-yama</i>, <i>yoi-yoi-yama</i>, and <i>yoi-yama</i>. On the evening of the 16th, every house puts out a shrine lantern and other works of art so that people are enticed to enter and examine. In the past, one reason for this custom was to give merchants the chance to show off their other goods. Another reason was for young marriageable women to show themselves off. This is evident in the kimono and haori silk dresses they wear that represent feminine beauty of body and apparel in youth.

                On the 17th, the main part of the festival, or hoko matsuri is held. It starts early in the morning with the many floats prepared to go along the Shijodori. The floats are either pulled by men or carried on their shoulders. There are musicians high up on the <i>hokodashi</i> that play special orchestral music called Gion <i>bayashi</i>. On every <i>hokodashi</i>, there is a <i>hoko no chigo</i> a ten year old boy drummer that is dressed up with a crown and makeup. The main float is called that <i>Naginata hokodashi</i> and represents the kami Susanoo.
