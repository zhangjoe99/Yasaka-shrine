            <div class="text">
                The Yasaka Shrine is one of the most famous shrines in Kyoto, known for its annual Gion Matsuri festival. The Shrine was founded over 1350 years ago under the reign of Emperor Seimei. The shrine was originally called the "Gion-sha" or "Kansin-in" and was changed to Yasaka at the time of the Meiji Restoration.

            <h4>Architecture</h4>
            <div class="text">
                Found between the Gion District and Higashiyama District
"The shrine's main hall combines the honden (inner sanctuary) and haiden (offering hall) into a single building. In front of it stands a dance stage with hundreds of lanterns that get lit in the evenings. Each lantern bears the name of a local business in return for a donation.""

As we approach Yasaka shrine, we might see the Nishi-romon gate on the east side with two bronze lion statues. The two lion statues represent the guardians of the shrine, similar to the many other guardian statues of other shrines. The Nishi-romon gate is considered the symbol of the Higashiyama district but the main gate is the Minami-romon Gate to the south. Rather than two guardian Deva kings we see at most shrine entrances, the Nishi-romon gate has two wooden statues of Zuishin.

The main hall is 15 meters tall and the roof is made of hinoki bark. The architecture is unique because it follows the Gion-zukuri style where the roof covers the front of the shrine as well as the main hall. 
The hall was rebuilt in 1654 by the 4th Tokugawa Shogun.
Legend says that there is a bottomless pond where a blue dragon resides under the main hall. The dragon draws energy from the water and acts as a guardian for Kyoto.

Buden hall holds all the ceremonies of the shrine and can even be used for weddings.

        <div class="festival">
            <h4>Festival</h4>
            <div class="text">
                The Gion festival is one of the most famous festivals in Japan and has been held in the Yasaka shrine for the past one thousand years. The festival began in 869 AD when an epidemic swept through the lands and the festival was a purification ritual to appease the kami. The festival is held between July 1 to 31. There are many ceremonies that take place during the festival. After much planning on July 1 and July 2, the first event occurs on July 10 called "Omukae-chouchin" (Paper lantern reception) and "Mikoshi-arai" (Ceremony to wash Mikoshi). Also, the "Hoko-tate" and "Yama-tate", massive floats for the parade, begin construction. On the 13th, there is a rite called "Naginata-boko Chigo-shasan" where children are chosen to ride on the Naginata-boko float in the festival. On July 28, there is also a purification ceremony held on the Shijo St. Bridge.

The days leading up to the precession are known as yoi-yoi-yoi-yama, yoi-yoi-yama, and yoi-yama. During the parade, musicians sit on the floats with lit paper lanterns.


"Arguably the most famous festival in the whole country, the Gion Matsuri dates back over a thousand years and involves a procession with massive floats and hundreds of participants. The shrine also becomes busy during the cherry blossom season around early April, as the adjacent Maruyama Park is one of the most famous cherry blossom spots in Kyoto."

        <div class="kami">
            <h4>Kami</h4>
            <div class="text">
                The kami associated with the Yasaka shrine are Amaterasu-Omikami and Susanoo-no-mikoto. Both these kami are heavenly and reside in the heavenly land Amatsukami.
"Susanoo-no-mikoto bewailed the death of his mother. After he defeated his elder sister, Amaterasu-Omikami, by the power comparison, his arrogance grew. He committed various crimes and was finally banished from the Plain of High Heaven. In the face of these adversities, he confronted various problems with great fortitude and at last, he overcame his adversities and broke new ground.""
Susanoo-no-mikoto is considered the most attractive deity in Japanese mythology

Ekijin shrine is a small shrine attached to Yasaka shrine
There is a myth where Susanoo-no-mikoto was traveling around Japan and met Somin Shorai, who offered shelter even though he was poor. Because of his kindness, Susanoo-no-mikoto told him that if an epidemic were to occur, Somin Shorai should wrap large thatch ropes around the waists of all his descendants. This would protect them from the disease. As a result, on July 31 of every year, Nagoshisai Matsuri is held at Ekijin shrine for Susanoo-no-mikoto. During the ceremony, people hand protective charms on a large thatch rope. The charms have the words "I am descended from Somin Shorai" on them and are hung on people’s doors to ward off evil.
